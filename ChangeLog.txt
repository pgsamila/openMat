2014-1-12 Supressed UNIX-style EOL warnings in IAR
2014-1-12 Removed angular velocity from CAN bus. Only calibrated gyroscope data makes sense.
2014-1-12 Set gyroscope threshold to value above 0. Why was it 0 anyway?
2014-1-12 Tested CAN bus communication at 1000 MB/s and 500 MB/s. Works alright.
2014-1-12 Version-up to 1.2.8
2014-1-12 Removed angular velocity output from default outputs.
2014-1-14 Added angular speed limit for gyro auto-calibration to prevent cancellation for constant motion.
2014-1-14 Still some versioning trouble, hopefully corrected.
